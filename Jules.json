Detailed view (MessageFormData) shows banner (log.b), time (log.c as locale string), reason (log.d). Navigation: List has 'Back' to main panel. Detail view returns to list. Limitations: Initial list lacks context (date/banner). ActionFormData button limit means not all logs may be visible if list is very long. Log Deletion Flaw: Deletes all logs for a player name (log.a) instead of the specific selected entry. Enhancements: 1. Initial list: Try adding date/banner to button text (e.g., 'Player - MM/DD - Admin'). 2. Log Deletion: CRITICAL - Fix deletion to be specific to the selected log, possibly using timestamp `log.c` for uniqueness or by filtering the exact object from the array if possible. 3. Data Structure: Consider adding unique IDs to log entries in the future for robustness. 4. UI for many logs: For very long lists, pagination or a different UI pattern might be needed (major change, future consideration)."
